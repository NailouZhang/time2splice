### A method to identify temporal and sex-specific alternative splicing from multi-omics data

####  Author: Ashley Mae Conard

Motivation
==========
Alternative splicing can occur in at least 3/4th of human genes to encode two or more splice isoforms, and these isoforms occur in different proportions over time, and between sexes. Thus, we present a method to characterize these isoforms, so to better understand gene regulation happening in normal and diseased states. Time2splice identifies temporal and sex-specific alternative splicing combinding multi-omic (i.e. both expression via RNA-seq, and protein-DNA interaction via CUT&RUN and ChIIP-seq) data.
